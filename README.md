# JavaScript-HTML-BasicIO
Basic HTML page where with input boxes that are read by a JavaScript program.

main() function reads in the two number boxes from the HTML page and sorts and prints the sequence of numbers input, then calls loopPrint()

loopPrint (numLoops) takes in the numLoops value that was read into the main function. It then prints out 'Output loop #' + i numLoops times
